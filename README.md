# Uber Data Analysis README

This project focuses on analyzing Uber data collected from the New York City government. The analysis includes data profiling, single variate and bivariate analysis, multidimensional data modeling using a star schema, and dashboarding in Power BI for revenue analysis, payment type analysis, and rides hotspot analysis.

## Data Collection

The Uber data used in this project was obtained from the New York City government's open data portal. The dataset includes information about Uber trips in New York City, such as trip duration, pickup and dropoff locations, fare amount, payment type, and more.

## Data Profiling

Before conducting the analysis, the data was profiled to gain insights into its structure, quality, and characteristics. Summarization techniques were applied to understand the distribution of variables, identify missing values, outliers, and potential data issues.

## Data Analysis

The analysis involved both single variate and bivariate analysis to explore relationships between different variables in the dataset. This helped uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that provide valuable insights into Uber trip characteristics and user behaviors.

## Multidimensional Data Modeling

To facilitate more complex analysis and reporting, a multidimensional data model was created using a star schema approach. This involved structuring the data into fact and dimension tables, enabling efficient querying and analysis across multiple dimensions.

## Dashboarding in Power BI

The analysis results were visualized and presented using Power BI, a powerful business intelligence tool. The dashboard includes interactive visualizations for revenue analysis, payment type analysis, and rides hotspot analysis. Users can explore the data dynamically and gain deeper insights into Uber trip metrics.

### Dashboard Components

- **Revenue Analysis**: Visualizations depicting revenue trends over time, by geographic location, and other relevant dimensions.
  
- **Payment Type Analysis**: Insights into the distribution of payment types used for Uber trips and their impact on revenue.

- **Rides Hotspot Analysis**: Interactive maps highlighting hotspots of Uber activity in New York City, helping identify areas with high demand and potential opportunities for business growth.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis and explore the dashboard:

1. Download the Uber dataset from the New York City government's open data portal.
2. Run the provided scripts for data profiling, analysis, and multidimensional data modeling.
3. Import the resulting data model into Power BI and customize the dashboard as needed.
